# Grunt Mode
Grunt Mode is a TF|2 Gamemode for the Northstar Client that quite simply turns you into a grunt.  

I actually don't really know how to mod for this game so there might be issues which I'll be willing to fix. 
# Features
- Boots on the ground combat
- No wallrunning or double jumping
- R201 and Grenades only 
  
### Install Guide:
- Download mod using the green button up the top of the page
- Unzip the file
- Place into the R2Northstar/mods folder
- Have fun or whatever. I don't really know if being a grunt is that fun.
